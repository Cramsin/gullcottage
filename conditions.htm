          be via our web site and sent to us with a deposit of One Hundred and Fifty Pounds (&pound;150.00), will only be effective when confirmed by us in writing. 
          We must receive the balance, together with an &quot;Accidental Damage 
          Deposit&quot; of &pound;100, not later than six weeks before the beginning 
          of your holiday. In the event of cancellation and if the property cannot 
          be re-let you will have to pay the whole quoted price for the period

          the property</b></font></p>
        <p align="left" class="text"><font size="-1">The cottage will available 
          for occupation from  3 p.m. on the first day of your 
          holiday and must be vacated by 10 a.m. on the last day. The licence 
          from the owner shall permit you and the members of your party as named 
          on the booking form only (no one else) to occupy the cottage for holiday 
          purposes only. For the avoidance of doubt, you may invite friends over 
          to visit but the number of people in the cottage must at no time exceed 
          the amount of people we have stated the cottage 'sleeps', unless you 
          have our prior consent. No one other than those on the Booking Confirmation 
          form may sleep at the cottage. Failure to observe these rules is likely 
          to be a serious breach (see Condition 8). You may not sub-let the cottage. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="left" class="text"><font size="-1">You must also comply with 
          any reasonable 'rules of the house' laid down by us, which have been 
          made to improve the use and enjoyment of the cottage for all concerned. 
          You should assume that all &quot;normal&quot; rules, such as consideration 
          for neighbours, apply. For example, if you would like to throw a party 
          you must obtain our consent in advance. We reserve the right to enter 
          the cottage at any reasonable time provided reasonable notice is given 
          to you. </font></p>

        <p align="left" class="text"><font size="-1">You must keep the cottage 
          clean and in good order and will be responsible for any breakages. We 
          shall be entitled to deduct from the Accidental Damage Deposit the cost 
          of remedying any breach of these obligations together with the cost 
          of any service or goods provided to or for you and for which you have 
          not paid. The amount of the Accidental Damage Deposit is normally &pound;100. 
          This sum is not an insurance premium and does not negate the clients 
          (tennants) liability for the full cost of any damage accidental or otherwise 
          occuring during the period of hire.</font></p>
        <p align="left" class="text"><font size="-1">The whole amount or the balance 
          after any deduction, as described above, of the Accidental Damage Deposit 
          will be refunded to you promptly following the end of the letting. </font></p>

        <p align="left" class="text"><font size="-1"> We have carefully inspected 
          the cottage and the information on our web site and in our information 
          leaflet is believed to be true and accurate. Whilst all reasonable efforts 
          have been made to ensure that descriptions and other information given 
          to you are accurate, we cannot accept responsibility for errors contained 
          in the information arising from routine maintenance, improvements or 
          modifications made by ourselves since our last rewrite of the information. 
          In any event, you acknowledge that minor differences may arise between 
          the photographs, illustrations and descriptions of cottage appearing 
          in the web page or printed information and the actual cottage. <br>

          with a cottage, or require maintenance or have any complaints, please 
          immediately notify the caretaker in the first instance. Because of the 
          difficulties in investigating the validity of any complaint once you 
          have departed from the cottage, we can only investigate those complaints 
          which are notified to us promptly and in any event before the end of 
          the holiday. </font></p>

        <p align="left" class="text"><font size="-1"> We may cancel any booking 
          already made if the cottage becomes unavailable for reasons beyond our 
          reasonable control. Examples of such reason may include flooding, fire, 
          and other significant damage to the cottage or failure of utility services 
          to the cottage. If this happens we will refund to you any sums you have 
          paid, but we shall have no other liability to you. </font></p>

        <p align="left" class="text"><font size="-1">We will not be liable for 
          any loss or damage suffered by you or any member of your party or to 
          your or their cottage, except where such loss or damage is due to our 
          negligence. If we are negligent, our liability to you will be limited 
          to the loss or damage which was a foreseeable result of such negligence. 
          Except in the case of death or personal injury resulting from our negligence, 
          the total liability of us to you in respect of any breach of these Terms 
          of Business or tort or other act or omission by us in connection with 
          this contract shall be limited in the aggregate to the price agreed 
          to be paid by you for the right to use the cottage for the period agreed. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="left" class="text"><font size="-1">Where you are a customer 
          acting in the course of a business, the Condition below shall apply 
          instead of the preceding.</font></p>
        <p align="left" class="text"><font size="-1"> We do not accept liability 
          to customers acting in the course of a business for losses of profits, 
          business, contracts, goodwill, anticipated savings, expenses, consequential 
          losses or other similar losses, for any reason whatsoever. To the extent 
          permitted by law and except in the case of personal injury or death 
          resulting from our negligence, the maximum limit of our liability to 
          business customers, whether in contract, tort, negligence, breach of 
          statutory duty or otherwise shall be the price agreed to be paid by 
          you for the right to use the cottage for the period agreed. </font></p>
        <p align="left" class="text"><font size="-1">We do try to help to ensure 
          that having chosen the cottage, that it is suitable for you, however 
          this is ultimately your responsibility and if you are unsure about an 
          issue, please check in advance. We reserve the right to refuse to accept 
          bookings in our absolute discretion. The cottage is unsuitable for wheelchairs 
          and the stairs are steep in the traditional style.<br>

          <a name="terminate"></a><b>Termination of your holiday</b></font></p>
        <p align="left" class="text"><font size="-1">If you commit a serious breach 
          of these Terms of Business we have the right to terminate your booking 
          and, if you are already at the cottage, we may require you to vacate 
          it at once. A serious breach of these Terms of Business may include 
          failure to comply with rules of the house or health and safety advice 
          or circumstances where your behaviour, or that of your guests, is likely 
          to have a significant adverse effect upon those staying or living nearby 
          the cottage. We will always try to act reasonably and will usually give 
          a warning but if, in the our judgement, you or your guests' behaviour 
          has made the possibility of your stay continuing untenable, you may 
          be asked to leave immediately. Unless we are able to find someone else 
          at short notice to rent the cottage for the remaining period, no refund 
          of the fees you have paid will be returnable to you.<br>

          <a name="dates"></a> <b>Changing dates</b></font></p>
        <p align="left" class="text"><font size="-1">Once dates of a booking have

          </font></p>
        <p align="left" class="text"><font size="-1">In the event of a cancellation, 
          we will make reasonable efforts to re-let the cottage and if we succeed 
          you will receive a refund. The refund will be the sum recovered by us 
          through re-letting less the any outstanding balance on your booking. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="left" class="text"><font size="-1">However, if we are unsuccessful 
          in re-letting, you will be liable for the full cost of the letting. 
          In any event, the balance of any monies due must be paid to us six weeks 
          before the start of the holiday in the usual way. </font></p>
